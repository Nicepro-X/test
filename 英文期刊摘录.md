><font size = 4>A vaccine strategy involving formulation changes, an initial escalating dose, and a longer wait for booster immunization results in more-effective antibody production against HIV in rhesus monkeys, a study finds.</font>

- Now, research published in [_Nature_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05216-9) this week (September 21) suggests that the solution to achieving effective protection may partially <b>lie in</b>[^lie-in] how the vaccine is delivered.

[^lie-in]:`phr.`存在于，在于

- But so far, she adds, the potential <b>clinical</b>[^clinical] implications of this study are “very exciting,” and not only for HIV; the approach holds <b>promise for</b> the development of vaccines against other targets, too.

[^bind]:`v.`结合；指抗体附着和转录的过程
[^pathogen]:`n.`病原体、病菌

- Among the hypotheses <b>derived from</b> their earlier work, Crotty’s team wondered whether gradual antigen delivery favors the initial period of this evolution and whether it lengthens the lifespan of these training centers to give B cells more time to <b>hone</b>[^hone] their antibodies and ultimately succeed against an <b>elusive</b>[^elusive] target such as HIV.

- Groups 2 and 3 (four individuals each) received an escalating dose <b>every other day</b>[^every-other-day] over a period of 12 days; instead of Alum, the formulation included a new immune-stimulating adjuvant called [saponin/MPLA nanoparticle](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciimmunol.abf1152).

[^every-other-day]:`phr.`每隔一天

<br>
- That a vaccine can generate antibodies to face different variants is generally <b>desirable</b>, but this is an even more <b>pressing</b>[^pressing] matter in the case of HIV, which <b>mutates</b>[^mutate] very rapidly.
